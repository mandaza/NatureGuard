NatureGuard is an innovative solution designed to streamline the management of Sunshine Coast Council's public spaces asset managment, by leveraging existing IoT infrastructure and predictive AI models. The goal is to optimize maintenance schedules, enhance asset utilization, improve visitor experiences, and protect Australia’s flora and fauna.

Key Features:

Dashboard for Reserve Management:
A user-friendly dashboard allows council members to monitor critical data for regions such as Sugar Bag and Mary Cairncross. This includes details on maintenance schedules, repair timelines and allocation, device health, and replacement needs. Additionally, sections are dedicated to tracking and discovering local flora and fauna, as well as recommending new additions to add to the reserves.

Predictive AI for Optimization:
The AI model forecasts visitor traffic, identifies high-traffic areas, and suggests optimized maintenance during quieter periods to minimize disruptions. A dedicated page provides insights into IoT device performance, including battery status and maintenance needs.

Automated Reports and Data Analytics:
Auto-generated reports offer detailed analyses with AI recommendations. Employees can access raw data to conduct their own analyses. The system also prioritizes repair tasks and generates schedules for staff, ensuring efficient workflows.

Visitor Management and Gamification:
TrailGuard’s AI distributes visitors across trails to reduce wear and tear. A gamified experience rewards visitors with points for activities like bike trail participation and flora/fauna discoveries, enhancing engagement and competition.

Flora and Fauna Identification:
Using an AI-based image recognizer, visitors can identify plant species in real-time via their smartphones. This feature is integrated with a scavenger hunt game, promoting interaction and discovery of new species, while supporting biodiversity conservation through data-driven planting recommendations. This is a feature which can be implemented in other areas outside of just the Sugar Bag and Mary Cairncross areas.

Comprehensive Plant Data Resource:
For council staff, the plant data page offers comprehensive information on all species within the reserves. The system tracks the geolocation of flora, allowing for the monitoring of environmental changes over time. Additionally, this data can be used to identify and plant other Australian fauna known to thrive in the area, thereby promoting biodiversity.

Impact:
TrailGuard utilizes IoT data and predictive analytics to create a more efficient, sustainable, and engaging trail experience for the Sunshine Coast community. It enhances reserve management, promotes biodiversity, and offers an interactive platform for visitors.
